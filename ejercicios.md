## Math

Write a JavaScript function to find the highest value in an array. Go to the editor
Test Data :

- max([12,34,56,1]);
- Res: 56
- max([-12,-34,0,-56,-1]);
- Res: 0

Write a JavaScript function to get the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two integers. Go to the editor

Note :
According to Wikipedia - In mathematics, the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two or more integers, when at least one of them is not zero, is the largest positive integer that divides the numbers without a remainder. For example, the GCD of 8 and 12 is 4. Test Data :

- gcd_two_numbers(12, 13);
- Res: 1
- gcd_two_numbers(9, 3));
- Res: 3

Write a JavaScript function to calculate the sum of values in an array. Go to the editor
Test Data :
- sum([1,2,3]);
- Res: 6
- sum([100,-200,3]);
- Res: -97
- sum([1,2,'a',3]);
- Res: 6

Create a Pythagorean function in JavaScript. Go to the editor
Note : The Pythagorean Theorem tells us that the relationship in every right triangle is : c2 = a2 + b2, where c is the hypotenuse and a, b are two legs of the triangle.
Test Data :

- pythagorean_theorem(2, 4));
- Res: 4.47213595499958
- pythagorean_theorem(3, 4));
